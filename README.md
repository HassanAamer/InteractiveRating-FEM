## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Native JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to add and remove classes to html elements using Native JavaScript
- How to add event-listeners to html elements.
- How to create reusable classes in CSS
- How to fix the brief flash of unstyled content when refreshing the page

### Continued development

An alert is generated whenever the submit button is pressed but no rating is selected. In the future I would like to implement functionality for an error message within the DOM to be generated as it looks nicer and more professional.
